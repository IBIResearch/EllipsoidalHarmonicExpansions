# EllipsoidalHarmonicExpansions
## Ellipsoidal Harmonic Expansions for Effective Measurement and Representation of Magnetic Fields

Examples for a Gradient Field and a B0 field present in low field MRI are provided. The general functionality can be concluded from those two examples. To do so, download the repository and execute
```
include("B0Field_Halbach.jl")
include("GradientField_Halbach.jl")
```

More details are given in *Efficient Measurement and Representation of Magnetic Fields in Tomographic Imaging Using Ellipsoidal Harmonics. Scheffler et al.. Under review.*
